# Fish& Zsh Custom Prompts, Alises, etc
I will try to keep everything I've created as custom prompts, aliases and so on for Fish and Zsh Shells.
For now at least, I've only created different prompts for them both.  I'll try to keep my current prompts located in the base directory of this repo with previous versions either saved into roughly dated folders or in an 'archive' folder where my previous versions whose dates I can't remember.

I doubt anybody else will ever actually end up using this.  I'm pretty certain that I'll use this for trying out several different distros while hunting for the winner that will end up being installed onto my new Acer!

Anything for Fish should go in either of these files & folders:
~/.config/fish
~/.config/fish/functions
~/.config/fish/functions/fish_prompt.fish
~/.config/fish/config.fish
~/.config/fish/fish_variables


And anything for Zsh should go in either of these files & folders:
~/.zshrc
~/.oh-my-zsh
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom
~/.oh-my-zsh/themes
~/.oh-my-zsh/templates
~/.oh-my-zsh/plugis
~/.oh-my-zsh/tools
~/.oh-my-zsh/lib
